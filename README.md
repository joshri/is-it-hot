# Is It Hot? Your Daily Guide.

+ Just input your city and you will receive your answer - as well as some advice - and a netflix recommendation - and whatever else I manage to throw into this thing. An ironic 'daily advice' page with random results. Except for whether it's hot or not - that will be for real.

## MVP
- I want to know whether it is hot, or whether it is not. (Display hot or not based on location)
- I want to know why I came to this site rather than just google the weather. (Add other fun API generated random goodies! Starting with random advice line, and random netflix recommendation. Also looking at horoscope, gif, joke, fashion(?!?!), and whatever else I can find).

## Stretch
- I want this page to help me escape from the deep sadness I feel every time I wake up in the morning. (Spa-like styling and calming animation using framer)
